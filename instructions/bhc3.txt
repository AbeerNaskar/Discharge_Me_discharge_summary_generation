Generate the "Brief Hospital Course" section of a hospital discharge summary from the following Discharge note, using the following structure and clinical style:

1. Begin by stating the patient,s reason for admission using clinical language.
2. Summarize the major active medical problems addressed during the hospital stay.
3. For each problem:
   - Describe the diagnostic workup performed (labs, imaging, consults).
   - Outline the treatments or interventions (medications, procedures, surgeries).
   - Comment on the patient,s clinical response and recovery status.
4. Include any relevant chronic issues managed or monitored during the stay.
5. Conclude with the discharge disposition (e.g., home, rehab) and any brief follow-up plans.

Use concise, problem-oriented medical language appropriate for clinicians. Group content by condition using headings such as:
   - # [Medical Problem]
   - # Chronic Conditions
   - # Transition of Care

Do not include patient instructions or non-clinical explanations. Focus only on in-hospital course and medical decision-making.
